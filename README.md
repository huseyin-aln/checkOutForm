## Acknowledgements
- To develop a real e-commerce website's checkout page. 
- There is a cart for buying products, and user can increase or decrease the number of products. 
- By changing a parameter in the cart, js functions calculate the cart total price. 
- DOM, iterator, callback functions, string-array functions and events are used in the page. 
- Additionally, user can remove products from the cart by clicking the remove button and decreasing the amount to "0". 
- In that case, the page asks user to delete the product from the cart. As soon as user confirmed the deletion, the chart total is recalculated by the js functions.
